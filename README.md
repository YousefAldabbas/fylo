## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

in future projects I want to focus in more complex projects not only landing page projects
### Useful resources

- [css breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) - are points where the website content responds according to the device width, allowing you to show the best possible layout to the user.
